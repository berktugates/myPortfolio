                <p>Hello, I am Berktuğ Berke Ateş. I am a software engineering student with a strong interest in web design and software development. I particularly enjoy exploring the boundaries of the digital world through frontend development and backend development.</p>
                <p>I had the exciting opportunity to work as a frontend developer intern at Prodrom ICT Solutions, where I was involved in real projects. This experience not only allowed me to enhance my technical skills but also emphasized the importance of teamwork.</p>
                <p>Outside of school, I have a great passion for sports and music. Bodybuilding has become a lifestyle and a way for me to maintain a healthy life. Additionally, playing the guitar is a delightful hobby and a stress-relief method to me.</p>
                <p>Currently, I am studying in the Software Engineering department at Fırat University, constantly striving to improve my knowledge and abilities. Being part of a rapidly advancing technological world motivates me, and I am determined to become a successful software expert in the future.</p>
                <p>I have created this portfolio website to share my projects and works with you. If you would like to get in touch, learn more about my projects, or collaborate, please don't hesitate to contact me.</p>
                <p>Thank you!</p>
